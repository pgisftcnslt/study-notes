# Chapter 2: Machine Learning Solution Framework and Azure AI Services

## Overview: Steps in Solving a Machine Learning Problem

Solving a machine learning problem involves a series of structured steps. This framework ensures the problem is well understood, data is properly handled, and models are effectively built and deployed.

---

## Step 1: Define the Problem

Clearly understand and define the business or technical problem you want to solve. Identify the goal, the type of prediction required (classification, regression, etc.), and the success criteria.

**Example:** Predicting whether a customer will churn (leave) a subscription service.

---

## Step 2: Get the Data

Collect the relevant data needed for the problem. This could be from databases, APIs, files, or external sources.

- Ensure data is sufficient in size and quality.
- Understand the features (variables) and the target (label).

**Example:** Customer records, usage history, and demographic data.

---

## Step 3: Prepare the Data

Clean and transform data for modeling.

- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Normalize or scale features.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.

Good data preparation leads to better model performance.

---

## Step 4: Train the Model

Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm and train it on the training data.

- Choose based on problem type and data.
- Tune hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

---

## Step 5: Evaluate the Model

Assess the trained modelâ€™s performance using validation and test datasets.

- Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (classification), or RMSE (regression).
- Check for overfitting or underfitting.

---

## Step 6: Deploy the Model

Put the model into production where it can make predictions on new data.

- Deploy as a web service or integrate into applications.
- Monitor performance and update as needed.
