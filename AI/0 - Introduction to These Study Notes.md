# Chapter 0: Introduction to These Study Notes

Welcome to my study notes for Artificial Intelligence (AI).

These notes are a work in progress and will continue to grow and evolve as I deepen my understanding and studies in the field of AI.

**Chapters 1-6** are specially focused on preparing for the AI-900 certification exam, covering core Azure AI services and foundational AI concepts.  
**Chapter 7** covers general AI knowledge beyond the AI-900 scope.

**Note:**  
I have used an AI assistant to edit and format these notes for clarity and readability.

Happy learning!
